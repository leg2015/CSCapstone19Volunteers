## What is Voluntunity?
Voluntunity is an interactive website for finding volunteer opportunities in the Austin-Georgetown-San Marcos area that is targeted towards [Southwestern University](www.southwestern.edu "Southwestern Homepage") students and other Georgetown residents. Users can search for opportunities based on the type of volunteer opportunity and the location.

## How do I use it?
From the landing page, simply select the category or city where you're interested in volunteering. If you don't want to select a specific city or category, then leave the dropdown as "Any" and it'll select everything. Once you hit search, the results page will pull up with cards on the left displaying each organization and google maps on the right displaying the locations.
